Based on the two pictures you provided, this React assignment requires you to complete the following tasks:

## 1. Submission form
You need to package your project into a .zip file and make sure that it can be used directly as a project directory after decompression.
Note: Package the contents of the project directory directly into the zip, rather than packaging the project directory itself into the zip.
The submitted zip file should include a fully filled-in instruction document (especially for the Implemented column) and place it in the root directory.
## 2. Application requirements
The application has at least three independent views, each of which displays different content.
Users can switch views in the following ways:
Menus (for example: drop-down menus or navigation bars)
Tab (tabs)
Buttons (buttons)
## 3. Routing function
The application's routing needs to meet the following requirements:
Users can navigate between different views using the browser's "forward" and "back" buttons.
The address in the browser address bar should change when switching views, and users can access the corresponding view by entering a specific URL.
## 4. Additional file requirements
You need to include the document ex04.odt in the zip file and submit it to the Exercise 4 area, not the "Programming assignment (mandatory)" area of ​​the programming assignment.
In short, what you need to do is:

Create a React project with at least 3 views and appropriate routing functions.
Make sure the routing functions meet the requirements, and the browser forward and backward, address bar displays different URLs and can directly navigate to the corresponding view.
Package and submit the project in the specified format, including the necessary instructions and ex04.odt file.
